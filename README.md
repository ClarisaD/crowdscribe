# Crowdscribe
---

Crowdscribe is a proof of concept from Open Audio Weekend at NYPL (June 25-26, 2016) for a Chrome extension that supports crowdsourced transcriptions. While on a webpage, users can request transcriptions of media using the extension, and users who are on the same page at the same time will get a notification to help transcribe media on the page.
